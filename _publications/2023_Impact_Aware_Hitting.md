excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a method for motion generation and controls for a 
robot manipulator to interact with the environment through a striking or hitting motion. Given the task 
of placing a known object outside of the workspace of the robot, the robot 
needs to come in contact with it at a non zero relative speed. The configuration 
of the robot and the speed at contact matter because they affect the motion of the object. 
The physical quantity that depends on the configuration, the robot speed and the properties 
of the environment is formulated and referred to here as 
pre-impact flux. An approach to achieve the desired directional pre-impact flux for 
the robot is presented. This is achieved through a combination of 
a dynamical system (DS) for motion generation and a control system that regulates the directional inertia of the robot. Furthermore, a Quadratic Program (QP)
formulation for achieving a desired inertia matrix at a desired position 
while following a motion plan constrained to the robot limits is presented. 
The system is tested for  different scenarios in simulation showing the repeatability of the 
procedure and in real scenarios with KUKA LBR iiwa 7 robot.'

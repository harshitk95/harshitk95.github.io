      abstract = {This paper builds up the skill of impact aware non  prehensile manipulation through a hitting motion by  allowing the robot arm to come in contact with the  environment with parts other than its end effector. Hitting  with other joints allows us to manipulate heavier objects  since the robot effective inertia is higher at joints other  than its end effector. Preliminary work to align the robot  to hit an object from a certain joint while having better  understanding of desired directional inertia values is  presented.},

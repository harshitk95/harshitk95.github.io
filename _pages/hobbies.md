### Dancing
<font size = "1">
I tend to learn dancing in a technical manner and that relates to my education in engineering and sciences. I will use this page as a way of describing how I think technicalities appear in the dances that I am and was a student of: [Argentine Tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_tango), [Lindy Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop), [Rock 'n' Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_(dance)), [Salsa (Cubana)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_salsa), [Bachata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachata_(dance)), [Standard and Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballroom_dance), [Forro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forr%C3%B3), [Tap Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance) and [Kathak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak#:~:text=Kathak%20is%20one%20of%20the,known%20as%20Kathakars%20or%20storytellers.).

### Music

My main instrument is [bansuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri). It is an Indian Classical bamboo flute. Over the years, I have dabbled and learnt playing Guitar, Piano, [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla), [Harmonium](https://www.britannica.com/art/harmonium-musical-instrument), and saxophone. 

### Sports

I currently play Ultimate Frisbee with [FlyHigh Lausanne](https://www.flyhigh.ultimate.ch/) and enjoy table tennis and badminton. I have a general affinity to flying objects and the physics of swing effects fascinates me.

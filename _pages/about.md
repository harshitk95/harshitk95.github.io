I am a Doctoral Assistant in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA)](http://lasa.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). 

Outside the lab, I am a dancer, musician and an amateur ultimate frisbee player. I am strongly interested in the intersection of performing arts and sciences, creation of mathematical models for performance arts. In my free time, I spend my time in becoming better in my hobbies and adding more of them time permitting. Keep a lookout at the projects for potential updates on the mathematical analysis of art-forms.

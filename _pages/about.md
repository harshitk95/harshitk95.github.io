I am a first year Doctoral Assistant in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA)](http://lasa.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Prior to that, I finished my masters in Robotics, Systems and Controls at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in 2019. I had the opportunity to complete internships at [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/), formerly Disney Research Zurich and [Fotokite](https://fotokite.com/). I completed my bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in 2016.

I am strongly interested in the intersection of performing arts and sciences, creation of mathematical models for performance arts. In my free time, I participate in learning music, and dancing

I am a third year Doctoral Assistant in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA)](http://lasa.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Prior to that, I completed my M.Sc. in Robotics, Systems and Controls at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in 2019. I had the opportunity to complete internships at [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/), formerly Disney Research Zurich and [Fotokite](https://fotokite.com/). I completed my bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) in 2016. During my bachelors, I spent a semester in [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) as an exchange student in 2014. and interned at [Singapore Technologies Kinetics](https://www.stengg.com/) in the summer of 2015.

I am strongly interested in the intersection of performing arts and sciences, creation of mathematical models for performance arts. In my free time, I spend my time in becoming better in my hobbies and adding more of them time permitting.
